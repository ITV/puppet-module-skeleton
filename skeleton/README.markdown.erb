## Development

To run tests, first bundle install:

```shell
$ bundle install
```

Then, for overall spec tests, including syntax, lint, and rspec, run:

```shell
$ bundle exec rake test
```

To run acceptance tests locally, we use vagrant; first set a few environment variables for the target system:

```shell
$ export BEAKER_set=vagrant-centos6
$ export BEAKER_destroy=no
```
Note: Setting `BEAKER_destroy=no` will allow you to login to the vagrant box that get's provisioned.

Then execute the acceptance tests:

```shell
$ bundle exec rake acceptance
```

In order to access the vagrant box that's been provisioner, there are two options:
Obtain the unique ID of the box using `vagrant global-status`, and then use `vagrant ssh [unique_id]`

Alternately, change to the directory of the Beaker generated Vagrantfile:
```
$ cd .vagrant/beaker_vagrant_files/$BEAKER_SET
```
and run `vagrant ssh` - if there are multiple boxes, you may need to use `vagrant ssh [box_name]`
